## 00_Reference
This folder contains some lectures related to plant control modeling, which are used in modeling the other projects here.

## 01_DC_motor
A first project --- Plant control for DC motor

- ***speed control*** : A DC motor model which is controlled by the reference angular speed.
-- **DCmotor_speed_control_parameter** : run this matlab file first to set up parameters to simulink model
-- **DCmotorSimulink_speed_control_motor** : simulink model
- ***torque control*** : A DC motor model which is controlled by the reference torque.
-- **DCmotor_Torque_control_parameters** : run this matlab file first to set up parameters to simulink model
-- **DCmotorSimulink_Torque_control** : simulink model
